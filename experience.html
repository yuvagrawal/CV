    <h1><b>My Experience..</b></h1>
    <br>
    <pre>To be very honest i have not much experience in coding
I firstly thought coding and techical skills are very difficult to acquire
(which indeed is true),but then i took computer science in 11<sup>th</sup>
then i came to know that it is not that tough and only requires continuous practice
and is very interesting and makes you feel big.I started taking python basic classes at School
and got fair enough at basic coding skills in python,but due to jee preparation my hand over
coding got loose and my interest also fell.This continued for 1st and 2nd semester in college
But now i will change it...
